By creating a min-heap(priority-queue in C++) of size 10.
Initially,we insert 10 elements into the priority queue.
Then we traverse the remaining elements int the list and if any of them is greater than the top of the priority queue,
then we remove the top element and insert the current element.

This approach takes 10Millionlog(10) time.
