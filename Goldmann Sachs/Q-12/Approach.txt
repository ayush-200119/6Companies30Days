Given a N*N Square chessboard, we can have squares having dimensions from 1*1 to N*N.

The total no. of 1*1 sqaures can be given by = (N-1+1)^2
Similarly, 2*2 can be given by = (N-2+1)^2

For a a*a square, the total no. van be given by =(N-a+1)^2

Thus we can calculate the total no. of squares by 

int total_squares=0;

for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
{
	total_squares+=((N-i+1)^2);
}

return total_squares;
